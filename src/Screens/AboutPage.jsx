                    UTA was established in 1895 as Arlington College, the first municipal junior college in Texas. It became Arlington
                    State College in 1959 and joined the UT System in 1965 as Arlington State College. The school was renamed The
                    University of Texas at Arlington in 1967. UTA was initially a commuter school but began expanding rapidly in the
                    1990s and 2000s, adding on-campus housing and increasing research expenditures. Key milestones include becoming a
                    national research university in 2009 and opening the $125 million Science & Engineering Innovation & Research
                    building in 2019.
